This repository contains the source code and the input data used in the simulations referenced in the article "Modeling of Smart Inverter Functions Executed by Photovoltaic Systems for Power Flow Analysis," submitted to EPSR in 2024.

The input data are presented in "data description.pdf" file and others .m files in the "test_systems" folder. It includes algorithms parameters, PV system configuration (PV module, inverter, topology and coupling transformer), smart inverter function configuration, test system, and scenarios configurations simulated.

The source code includes the proposed modeling in "prop" folder and DSF modeling (OpenDSS modeling implementation) in "DSF" folder.
